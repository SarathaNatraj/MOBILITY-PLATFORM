Task 2: Implement a form to add new transactions, categorizing them as either income or expenses.\
Task 3: Develop interaction logic that allows users to edit or delete transactions from the database.\
Task 4: Set up navigation flows to move between the dashboard, transaction list, and transaction creation form.\
Task 5: Implement state management using the Combine framework to update the user interface reactively as transactions are added or modified.\
Task 6: Create publishers and subscribers that handle the loading and saving of transaction data in real-time.}

User Story 3 - Camera feature
Pre-reqeustite: Claims should be already there in db, We are displaying existing claims in RecyclerView
1. UI have option to upload image for Claim, add in to your activity/fragment.xml
	androidx.camera.view.PreviewView
	Button -> to capture the image
	RecyclerView -> to show list of captured images
BackEnd :-
2. Create model Class ClaimImage (id, claim_id, imagePath)
3. Create a Dao for ClaimImageDao
4. Add ClaimImageDao into your database.
5. Add dependencies in build.gradle.kts
    implementation ("androidx.camera:camera-core:1.3.0")
    implementation ("androidx.camera:camera-camera2:1.3.0")

    implementation ("androidx.camera:camera-view:1.3.0")
    implementation ("androidx.camera:camera-lifecycle:1.3.0")
6. Inside Activity/Fragment for particular claim_id, existing images show image
7. Connect with Camera -> Check permission through code -> then call startCamera()

    	implementation ("com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:4.9.1")
2. Construct the model -> based on your response
3. Create Service interface -> APIService
	define all the methods for connecting API, getPolicyDetails, getCompanyInfo, getTopHeadlines,
	each method annotated with @GET with specific end-point
4. Inside MainActivity
	1. Initialize Retrofit
		https://677636ef12a55a9a7d0ae13a.mockapi.io - baseUrl
		https://677636ef12a55a9a7d0ae13a.mockapi.io/company - URL with company endpoint
		https://677636ef12a55a9a7d0ae13a.mockapi.io/policy - URL with policy endpoint
